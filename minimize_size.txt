With MSVC add the following compiler switches to reduce the size of the 
generated executable (I assume you build in release mode...)

Compiler
========= 
/GS- (no buffer overrun checks)
/O1 (optimize for size)
/MD (do not statically link to the CRT library)            

Linker
======= 
/entry:"main" (do not use the default CRT entry point "start")
kernel32.lib (has to be added manually)
/MERGE:.rdata=.text /MERGE:.data=.text (merge code and data sections; USE WITH CAUTION!)
/ALIGN:4 or /ALIGN:8 (set alignment; default is 512! USE WITH CAUTION!)
